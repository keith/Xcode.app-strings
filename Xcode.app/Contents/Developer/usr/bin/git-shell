Reverting is not possible because you have unmerged files.
It is not possible to %s because you have unmerged files.
Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'
as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.
Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
Please, commit your changes before merging.
Exiting because of unfinished merge.
Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
The following paths and/or pathspecs matched paths that exist
outside of your sparse-checkout definition, so will not be
updated in the index:
If you intend to update such entries, try one of the following:
* Use the --sparse option.
* Disable or modify the sparsity rules.
Note: switching to '%s'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>
Or undo this operation with:
  git switch -
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
The following paths have been moved outside the
sparse-checkout definition but are not sparse due to local
modifications.
To correct the sparsity of these paths, do the following:
* Use "git add --sparse <paths>" to update the index
* Use "git sparse-checkout reapply" to apply the sparsity rules

Recursive merging with submodules currently only supports trivial cases.
Please manually handle the merging of each conflicted submodule.
This can be accomplished with the following steps:
%s - come back to superproject and run:

refname '%.*s' is ambiguous.
Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters
because it will be ignored when you just specify 40-hex. These refs
may be created by mistake. For example,
  git switch -c $br $(git rev-parse ...)
where "$br" is somehow empty and a 40-hex ref is created. Please
examine these refs and maybe delete them. Turn this message off by
running "git config advice.objectNameWarning false"

e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
                   commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
                   keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
                   opens the editor
x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
d, drop <commit> = remove commit
l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
        create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
        message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
        specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
u, update-ref <ref> = track a placeholder for the <ref> to be updated
                      to this position in the new commits. The <ref> is
                      updated at the end of the rebase
These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
Rebase %s onto %s (%d command)

Do not remove any line. Use 'drop' explicitly to remove a commit.
If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
You are editing the todo file of an ongoing interactive rebase.
To continue rebase after editing, run:
    git rebase --continue
However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.

The destination you provided is not a full refname (i.e.,
starting with "refs/"). We tried to guess what you meant by:
- Looking for a ref that matches '%s' on the remote side.
- Checking if the <src> being pushed ('%s')
  is a ref in "refs/{heads,tags}/". If so we add a corresponding
  refs/{heads,tags}/ prefix on the remote side.
Neither worked, so we gave up. You must fully qualify the ref.
'%s' is not a valid object, match_explicit_lhs() should catch this!
The <src> part of the refspec is a commit object.
Did you mean to create a new branch by pushing to
'%s:refs/heads/%s'?
The <src> part of the refspec is a tag object.
Did you mean to create a new tag by pushing to

branch that already exists at the remote, you may need to
run "git fetch" to retrieve it.
If you are planning to push out a new local branch that
will track its remote counterpart, you may want to use
"git push -u" to set the upstream config as you push.

Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
Please, commit your changes before merging.
Exiting because of unfinished merge.
Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
The following paths and/or pathspecs matched paths that exist
outside of your sparse-checkout definition, so will not be
updated in the index:
If you intend to update such entries, try one of the following:
* Use the --sparse option.
* Disable or modify the sparsity rules.
Note: switching to '%s'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>
Or undo this operation with:
  git switch -
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
The following paths have been moved outside the
sparse-checkout definition but are not sparse due to local
modifications.
To correct the sparsity of these paths, do the following:
* Use "git add --sparse <paths>" to update the index
* Use "git sparse-checkout reapply" to apply the sparsity rules

 - go to submodule (%s), and either merge commit %s
   or update to an existing commit which has merged those changes
Recursive merging with submodules currently only supports trivial cases.
Please manually handle the merging of each conflicted submodule.
This can be accomplished with the following steps:
%s - come back to superproject and run:
      git add %s
   to record the above merge or update
 - resolve any other conflicts in the superproject
 - commit the resulting index in the superproject

Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters
because it will be ignored when you just specify 40-hex. These refs
may be created by mistake. For example,
  git switch -c $br $(git rev-parse ...)
where "$br" is somehow empty and a 40-hex ref is created. Please
examine these refs and maybe delete them. Turn this message off by

Do not remove any line. Use 'drop' explicitly to remove a commit.
If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
You are editing the todo file of an ongoing interactive rebase.
To continue rebase after editing, run:
    git rebase --continue
However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.

The destination you provided is not a full refname (i.e.,
starting with "refs/"). We tried to guess what you meant by:
- Looking for a ref that matches '%s' on the remote side.
- Checking if the <src> being pushed ('%s')
  is a ref in "refs/{heads,tags}/". If so we add a corresponding
  refs/{heads,tags}/ prefix on the remote side.
Neither worked, so we gave up. You must fully qualify the ref.
'%s' is not a valid object, match_explicit_lhs() should catch this!
The <src> part of the refspec is a commit object.
Did you mean to create a new branch by pushing to

will track its remote counterpart, you may want to use
"git push -u" to set the upstream config as you push.
