'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some

to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
You've added another git repository inside your current repository.
Clones of the outer repository will not contain the contents of
the embedded repository and will not know how to obtain it.
If you meant to add a submodule, use:
git submodule add <url> %s
If you added this path by mistake, you can remove it from the
index with:
git rm --cached %s
See "git help submodule" for more information.
You need to give me at least one %s and %s revision.
You can use "git bisect %s" and "git bisect %s" for that.

good|old
You need to start by "git bisect start".
You then need to give me at least one %s and %s revision.
You can use "git bisect %s" and "git bisect %s" for that.
git check-ref-format [--normalize] [<options>] <refname>
   or: git check-ref-format --branch <branchname-shorthand>
Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.
You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'
You asked to amend the most recent commit, but doing so would make
it empty. You can repeat your command with --allow-empty, or you can
remove the commit entirely with "git reset HEAD^".
The previous cherry-pick is now empty, possibly due to conflict resolution.
If you wish to commit it anyway, use:
    git commit --allow-empty
Otherwise, please use 'git cherry-pick --skip'
and then use:
    git cherry-pick --continue
to resume cherry-picking the remaining commits.
If you wish to skip this commit, use:
    git cherry-pick --skip
Otherwise, please use 'git rebase --skip'

To push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)
state now, use
    git push %s HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>
Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
'git pull ...') before pushing again.
See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
(e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Updates were rejected because the tag already exists in the remote.
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
(e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
You cannot update a remote ref that points at a non-commit object,
or update a remote ref to make it point at a non-commit object,
without using the '--force' option.
Updates were rejected because the tip of the remote-tracking
branch has been updated since the last checkout. You may want
to integrate those changes locally (e.g., 'git pull ...')
before forcing an update.

If there is nothing left to stage, chances are that something else

You still have unmerged paths in your index.
You should 'git add' each file with resolved conflicts to mark them as such.

There is no candidate for rebasing against among the refs that you just fetched.
There are no candidates for merging among the refs that you just fetched.
Generally this means that you provided a wildcard refspec which had no
matches on the remote end.
You asked to pull from the remote '%s', but did not specify
a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
You are not currently on a branch.
Please specify which branch you want to rebase against.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.
    git pull %s %s
<remote>
<branch>
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:
    git branch --set-upstream-to=%s/%s %s
Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref '%s'
from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
unable to access commit %s
You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
your next pull:
  git config pull.rebase false  # merge
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.

You didn't specify any refspecs to push, and push.default is "nothing".
You are pushing to remote '%s', which is not the upstream of
your current branch '%s', without telling me what to push
to update which remote branch.
To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
The current branch %s has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
    git push --set-upstream %s %s
The current branch %s has multiple upstream branches, refusing to push.
To choose either option permanently, see push.default in 'git help config'.
To avoid automatically configuring an upstream branch when its name
won't match the local branch, see option 'simple' of branch.autoSetupMerge
in 'git help config'.
The upstream branch of your current branch does not match
the name of your current branch.  To push to the upstream branch
on the remote, use
    git push %s HEAD:%s

warning: 
By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent
with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match
the work tree to HEAD.
You can set the 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable
to 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into
its current branch; however, this is not recommended unless you
arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some
other way.
To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set
'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to 'refuse'.
By default, deleting the current branch is denied, because the next

The following paths and/or pathspecs matched paths that exist
outside of your sparse-checkout definition, so will not be
updated in the index:
If you intend to update such entries, try one of the following:
* Use the --sparse option.
* Disable or modify the sparsity rules.
Note: switching to '%s'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>
Or undo this operation with:
  git switch -
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
The following paths have been moved outside the
sparse-checkout definition but are not sparse due to local
modifications.
To correct the sparsity of these paths, do the following:
* Use "git add --sparse <paths>" to update the index
* Use "git sparse-checkout reapply" to apply the sparsity rules

Recursive merging with submodules currently only supports trivial cases.
Please manually handle the merging of each conflicted submodule.
This can be accomplished with the following steps:
%s - come back to superproject and run:
      git add %s
   to record the above merge or update
 - resolve any other conflicts in the superproject
 - commit the resulting index in the superproject

refname '%.*s' is ambiguous.
Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters
because it will be ignored when you just specify 40-hex. These refs
may be created by mistake. For example,
  git switch -c $br $(git rev-parse ...)
where "$br" is somehow empty and a 40-hex ref is created. Please
examine these refs and maybe delete them. Turn this message off by
running "git config advice.objectNameWarning false"

l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
        create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
        message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was

To continue rebase after editing, run:
    git rebase --continue
However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.

Neither worked, so we gave up. You must fully qualify the ref.

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
You've added another git repository inside your current repository.
Clones of the outer repository will not contain the contents of
the embedded repository and will not know how to obtain it.
If you meant to add a submodule, use:
git submodule add <url> %s
If you added this path by mistake, you can remove it from the
index with:
git rm --cached %s
See "git help submodule" for more information.
You need to give me at least one %s and %s revision.
You can use "git bisect %s" and "git bisect %s" for that.
bad|new
good|old
You need to start by "git bisect start".
You then need to give me at least one %s and %s revision.
You can use "git bisect %s" and "git bisect %s" for that.
git check-ref-format [--normalize] [<options>] <refname>
   or: git check-ref-format --branch <branchname-shorthand>
Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.
You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'
You asked to amend the most recent commit, but doing so would make
it empty. You can repeat your command with --allow-empty, or you can
remove the commit entirely with "git reset HEAD^".
The previous cherry-pick is now empty, possibly due to conflict resolution.
If you wish to commit it anyway, use:
    git commit --allow-empty
Otherwise, please use 'git cherry-pick --skip'
and then use:
    git cherry-pick --continue
to resume cherry-picking the remaining commits.
If you wish to skip this commit, use:
    git cherry-pick --skip
Otherwise, please use 'git rebase --skip'

    git push %s HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>
Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
'git pull ...') before pushing again.
See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
(e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Updates were rejected because the tag already exists in the remote.
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
(e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
You cannot update a remote ref that points at a non-commit object,
or update a remote ref to make it point at a non-commit object,
without using the '--force' option.
Updates were rejected because the tip of the remote-tracking
branch has been updated since the last checkout. You may want
to integrate those changes locally (e.g., 'git pull ...')
before forcing an update.

branch that already exists at the remote, you may need to

If you are planning to push out a new local branch that
will track its remote counterpart, you may want to use
"git push -u" to set the upstream config as you push.

You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default

You didn't specify any refspecs to push, and push.default is "nothing".
You are pushing to remote '%s', which is not the upstream of

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking

The current branch %s has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
    git push --set-upstream %s %s
The current branch %s has multiple upstream branches, refusing to push.

warning: 
By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent
with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match
the work tree to HEAD.
You can set the 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable
to 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into
its current branch; however, this is not recommended unless you
arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some
other way.
To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set
'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to 'refuse'.
By default, deleting the current branch is denied, because the next
'git clone' won't result in any file checked out, causing confusion.
You can set 'receive.denyDeleteCurrent' configuration variable to
'warn' or 'ignore' in the remote repository to allow deleting the
current branch, with or without a warning message.
To squelch this message, you can set it to 'refuse'.

The following paths and/or pathspecs matched paths that exist
outside of your sparse-checkout definition, so will not be
updated in the index:
If you intend to update such entries, try one of the following:
* Use the --sparse option.
* Disable or modify the sparsity rules.
Note: switching to '%s'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
  git switch -c <new-branch-name>
Or undo this operation with:
  git switch -
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
The following paths have been moved outside the
sparse-checkout definition but are not sparse due to local
modifications.
To correct the sparsity of these paths, do the following:
* Use "git add --sparse <paths>" to update the index
* Use "git sparse-checkout reapply" to apply the sparsity rules

The destination you provided is not a full refname (i.e.,
starting with "refs/"). We tried to guess what you meant by:
- Looking for a ref that matches '%s' on the remote side.
- Checking if the <src> being pushed ('%s')
  is a ref in "refs/{heads,tags}/". If so we add a corresponding
  refs/{heads,tags}/ prefix on the remote side.
Neither worked, so we gave up. You must fully qualify the ref.
'%s' is not a valid object, match_explicit_lhs() should catch this!
