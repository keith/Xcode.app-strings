<pid | partial-process-name> [duration [samplingInterval]] [options...]
       sample <memgraph>
Specify the duration in seconds;  the default is %d seconds.
Specify the samplingInterval in milliseconds;  the default is %d millisecond.
options: [-wait] [-mayDie] [-fullPaths] [-e] [-file <filename>]
wait
wait until the process named (usually by partial name) exists, then start sampling
v8@?0
mayDie
reads symbol information right away
fullPaths
show full paths to source files if debug info is available
open the output in TextEdit
stdoutOnly
bySymbol
nodsyms
file
filename
specifies where results should be written
v24@?0@"NSString"8^@16
noSwiftAsync
just collect regular backtraces, not Swift Async extended backtraces
