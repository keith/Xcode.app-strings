Usage: redis-cli [OPTIONS] [cmd [arg [arg ...]]]
  -h <hostname>      Server hostname (default: 127.0.0.1).
  -p <port>          Server port (default: 6379).
  -s <socket>        Server socket (overrides hostname and port).
  -a <password>      Password to use when connecting to the server.
  -r <repeat>        Execute specified command N times.
  -i <interval>      When -r is used, waits <interval> seconds per command.
                     It is possible to specify sub-second times like -i 0.1.
  -n <db>            Database number.
  -x                 Read last argument from STDIN.
  -d <delimiter>     Multi-bulk delimiter in for raw formatting (default: \n).
  -c                 Enable cluster mode (follow -ASK and -MOVED redirections).
  --raw              Use raw formatting for replies (default when STDOUT is
                     not a tty).
  --csv              Output in CSV format.
  --latency          Enter a special mode continuously sampling latency.
  --latency-history  Like --latency but tracking latency changes over time.
                     Default time interval is 15 sec. Change it using -i.
  --slave            Simulate a slave showing commands received from the master.
  --rdb <filename>   Transfer an RDB dump from remote server to local file.
  --pipe             Transfer raw Redis protocol from stdin to server.
  --pipe-timeout <n> In --pipe mode, abort with error if after sending all data.
                     no reply is received within <n> seconds.
                     Default timeout: %d. Use 0 to wait forever.
  --bigkeys          Sample Redis keys looking for big keys.
  --scan             List all keys using the SCAN command.
  --pattern <pat>    Useful with --scan to specify a SCAN pattern.
  --intrinsic-latency <sec> Run a test to measure intrinsic system latency.
                     The test will run for the specified amount of seconds.
  --eval <file>      Send an EVAL command using the Lua script at <file>.
  --help             Output this help and exit.
  --version          Output version and exit.
Examples:
  cat /etc/passwd | redis-cli -x set mypasswd
  redis-cli get mypasswd
  redis-cli -r 100 lpush mylist x
  redis-cli -r 100 -i 1 info | grep used_memory_human:
  redis-cli --eval myscript.lua key1 key2 , arg1 arg2 arg3
  redis-cli --scan --pattern '*:12345*'
  (Note: when using --eval the comma separates KEYS[] from ARGV[] items)
When no command is given, redis-cli starts in interactive mode.
Type "help" in interactive mode for information on available commands.
