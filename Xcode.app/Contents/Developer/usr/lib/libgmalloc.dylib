Explicitly trapping into debugger!!!
If you run under the debugger, it will automatically break here.

environment variables that can be set for GuardMalloc:
- MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE protects against buffer underruns by placing buffers at start of VM pages
- MALLOC_FILL_SPACE fills buffer with 0xaa upon creation, to help catch uninitialized memory problems
     (similar to MallocScribble)
- MALLOC_ALLOW_READS makes guard pages readable so that reads of bytes in guard pages don't cause crashes
- MALLOC_VECTOR_SIZE places allocations on 16-byte boundaries for use with vector instructions
     (this is the default)
- MALLOC_WORD_SIZE places allocations on 4-byte boundaries
- MALLOC_STRICT_SIZE places allocations on single-byte boundaries, aligned with end of page
     unless MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE is set
- MALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_REQUESTS allows allocations greater than 100MB without error
- MALLOC_CHECK_HEADER=NO turns off validating malloc block header when block is freed or reallocated
MALLOC_ALLOW_READS requires VM address reuse to be enabled, but it was explicitly disabled with DISABLE_ADDRESS_REUSE
MALLOC_ALLOW_READS is set;  this will double VM region use by explicitly allocating guard pages on which to set read permission.
Allocations will be placed on byte boundaries.
 - Overrunning a buffer will cause an immediate crash. (Good.)
 - Applications expecting word-aligned pointers may fail (such as Carbon applications)
 - Applications using vector instructions (e.g., SSE) may fail.
Allocations will be placed on word (4 byte) boundaries.
 - Small buffer overruns may not be noticed.
Allocations will be placed on 16 byte boundaries.
 - Some buffer overruns may not be noticed.
 - Applications using vector instructions (e.g., SSE) should work.
version 064562.1.1
This process is running with libgmalloc.dylib (GuardMalloc) which may have forced the crash due to a memory access error.

Sysctl (debug.toggle_address_reuse) error
malloc_size is returning a suspiciously large value:  %ld bytes
If this is expected behavior, launch your executable with the environment variable MALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_REQUESTS set to any value to circumvent this check.
malloc_size of %p is %ld -- seems wrong
Attempting excessively large memory allocation:  %lu bytes
If you really wanted to allocate so much memory, launch your executable with the environment variable MALLOC_ALLOW_LARGE_REQUESTS set to any value to circumvent this check.
Attempting to allocate %lu bytes, with alignment %lu, which causes arithmetic overflow, so allocation fails and NULL will be returned
requested malloc of 0 bytes.
Attempting to allocate %lu to represent %lu bytes, which would bring VM size to %lu. That exceeds the %lu VM maximum set via MALLOC_MAXIMUM_VM env var.

Tried to free pointer %p in zone %s which is not currently a pointer to a malloc buffer.
Tried to realloc pointer %p in zone %s which is not currently a pointer to a malloc buffer.
