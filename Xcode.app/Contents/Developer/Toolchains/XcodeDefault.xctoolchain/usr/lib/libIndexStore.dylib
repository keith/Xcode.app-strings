openmp-ir-builder-unroll-threshold-factor
Factor for the unroll threshold to account for code simplifications still taking place

unroll-partial-threshold
The cost threshold for partial loop unrolling
unroll-max-percent-threshold-boost
The maximum 'boost' (represented as a percentage >= 100) applied to the threshold when aggressively unrolling a loop due to the dynamic cost savings. If completely unrolling a loop will reduce the total runtime from X to Y, we boost the loop unroll threshold to DefaultThreshold*std::min(MaxPercentThresholdBoost, X/Y).

unroll-threshold-default
Default threshold (max size of unrolled loop), used in all but O3 optimizations

openmp-ir-builder-unroll-threshold-factor
Factor for the unroll threshold to account for code simplifications still taking place
forget-scev-loop-unroll

unroll-partial-threshold
The cost threshold for partial loop unrolling
unroll-max-percent-threshold-boost
The maximum 'boost' (represented as a percentage >= 100) applied to the threshold when aggressively unrolling a loop due to the dynamic cost savings. If completely unrolling a loop will reduce the total runtime from X to Y, we boost the loop unroll threshold to DefaultThreshold*std::min(MaxPercentThresholdBoost, X/Y).

Default threshold (max size of unrolled loop), used in all but O3 optimizations
