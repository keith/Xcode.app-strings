Error Parsing encoding_decl
parse tree does not use a valid start symbol
unspecified ST error occurred
Illegal syntax-tree; cannot start with terminal symbol.
missed encoding
encoding must be a string, found %.200s
Illegal node construct.
terminal nodes must have 2 or 3 entries
second item in terminal node must be a string, found %s
third item in terminal node must be an integer, found %s
unsupported number of child nodes
Unrecognized node type %d.
