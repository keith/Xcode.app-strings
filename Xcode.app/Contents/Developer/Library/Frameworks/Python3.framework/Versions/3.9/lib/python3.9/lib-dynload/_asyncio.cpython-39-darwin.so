Accelerator module for asyncio
get_event_loop($module, /)
Return an asyncio event loop.
When called from a coroutine or a callback (e.g. scheduled with
call_soon or similar API), this function will always return the
running event loop.
If there is no running event loop set, the function will return
the result of `get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()` call.
get_running_loop($module, /)
Return the running event loop.  Raise a RuntimeError if there is none.
This function is thread-specific.
_get_running_loop($module, /)
Return the running event loop or None.
This is a low-level function intended to be used by event loops.
This function is thread-specific.
_set_running_loop($module, loop, /)
Set the running event loop.
This is a low-level function intended to be used by event loops.
This function is thread-specific.
_register_task($module, /, task)
Register a new task in asyncio as executed by loop.
Returns None.
_unregister_task($module, /, task)
Unregister a task.
Returns None.
_enter_task($module, /, loop, task)
Enter into task execution or resume suspended task.
Task belongs to loop.
Returns None.
_leave_task($module, /, loop, task)
Leave task execution or suspend a task.
Task belongs to loop.
Returns None.
Future(*, loop=None)
This class is *almost* compatible with concurrent.futures.Future.
    Differences:
    - result() and exception() do not take a timeout argument and
      raise an exception when the future isn't done yet.
    - Callbacks registered with add_done_callback() are always called
      via the event loop's call_soon_threadsafe().
    - This class is not compatible with the wait() and as_completed()
      methods in the concurrent.futures package.
result($self, /)
Return the result this future represents.
If the future has been cancelled, raises CancelledError.  If the
future's result isn't yet available, raises InvalidStateError.  If
the future is done and has an exception set, this exception is raised.
exception($self, /)
Return the exception that was set on this future.
The exception (or None if no exception was set) is returned only if
the future is done.  If the future has been cancelled, raises
CancelledError.  If the future isn't done yet, raises
InvalidStateError.
set_result($self, result, /)
Mark the future done and set its result.
If the future is already done when this method is called, raises
InvalidStateError.
set_exception($self, exception, /)
Mark the future done and set an exception.
If the future is already done when this method is called, raises
InvalidStateError.
add_done_callback($self, fn, /, *, context=<unrepresentable>)
Add a callback to be run when the future becomes done.
The callback is called with a single argument - the future object. If
the future is already done when this is called, the callback is
scheduled with call_soon.
remove_done_callback($self, fn, /)
Remove all instances of a callback from the "call when done" list.
Returns the number of callbacks removed.
cancel($self, /, msg=None)
Cancel the future and schedule callbacks.
If the future is already done or cancelled, return False.  Otherwise,
change the future's state to cancelled, schedule the callbacks and
return True.
cancelled($self, /)
Return True if the future was cancelled.
done($self, /)
Return True if the future is done.
Done means either that a result / exception are available, or that the
future was cancelled.
get_loop($self, /)
Return the event loop the Future is bound to.
_make_cancelled_error($self, /)
Create the CancelledError to raise if the Future is cancelled.
This should only be called once when handling a cancellation since
it erases the context exception value.
_repr_info($self, /)
Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A coroutine wrapped in a Future.
set_result($self, result, /)
set_exception($self, exception, /)
cancel($self, /, msg=None)
Request that this task cancel itself.
This arranges for a CancelledError to be thrown into the
wrapped coroutine on the next cycle through the event loop.
The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny
the request using try/except/finally.
Unlike Future.cancel, this does not guarantee that the
task will be cancelled: the exception might be caught and
acted upon, delaying cancellation of the task or preventing
cancellation completely.  The task may also return a value or
raise a different exception.
Immediately after this method is called, Task.cancelled() will
not return True (unless the task was already cancelled).  A
task will be marked as cancelled when the wrapped coroutine
terminates with a CancelledError exception (even if cancel()
was not called).
get_stack($self, /, *, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this task's coroutine.
If the coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is
suspended.  If the coroutine has completed successfully or was
cancelled, this returns an empty list.  If the coroutine was
terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback
frames.
The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.
The optional limit gives the maximum number of frames to
return; by default all available frames are returned.  Its
meaning differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is
returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the
oldest frames of a traceback are returned.  (This matches the
behavior of the traceback module.)
For reasons beyond our control, only one stack frame is
returned for a suspended coroutine.
print_stack($self, /, *, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this task's coroutine.
This produces output similar to that of the traceback module,
for the frames retrieved by get_stack().  The limit argument
is passed to get_stack().  The file argument is an I/O stream
to which the output is written; by default output is written
to sys.stderr.
_make_cancelled_error($self, /)
Create the CancelledError to raise if the Task is cancelled.
This should only be called once when handling a cancellation since
it erases the context exception value.
_repr_info($self, /)
get_name($self, /)
set_name($self, value, /)

_register_task($module, /, task)
Register a new task in asyncio as executed by loop.
Returns None.

Unregister a task.
Returns None.
_enter_task($module, /, loop, task)
Enter into task execution or resume suspended task.
Task belongs to loop.
Returns None.
_leave_task($module, /, loop, task)
Leave task execution or suspend a task.
Task belongs to loop.
Returns None.
