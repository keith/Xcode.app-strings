MallocHelp
environment variables that can be set for debug:
- MallocLogFile <f> to create/append messages to file <f> instead of stderr
- MallocGuardEdges to add 2 guard pages for each large block
- MallocDoNotProtectPrelude to disable protection (when previous flag set)
- MallocDoNotProtectPostlude to disable protection (when previous flag set)
- MallocStackLogging to record all stacks.  Tools like leaks can then be applied
- MallocStackLoggingNoCompact to record all stacks.  Needed for malloc_history
- MallocStackLoggingDirectory to set location of stack logs, which can grow large; default is /tmp
- MallocScribble to detect writing on free blocks and missing initializers:
  0x55 is written upon free and 0xaa is written on allocation
- MallocCheckHeapStart <n> to start checking the heap after <n> operations
- MallocCheckHeapEach <s> to repeat the checking of the heap after <s> operations
- MallocCheckHeapSleep <t> to sleep <t> seconds on heap corruption
- MallocCheckHeapAbort <b> to abort on heap corruption if <b> is non-zero
- MallocCorruptionAbort to abort on malloc errors, but not on out of memory for 32-bit processes
  MallocCorruptionAbort is always set on 64-bit processes
- MallocErrorAbort to abort on any malloc error, including out of memory
- MallocTracing to emit kdebug trace points on malloc entry points
