Transcoding
Supported video utis: %@
Checking if we support the AV uti: %@
Trying to discriminate based on type alone:
preserveHDR
   Start time: %f
     End time: %f
     Duration: %f
  assetLibURI: %@
  isAuxVideo: %@
 removeAlpha: %@
 preserveHDR: %@
 Start time > 0, we need to transcode
 End time > 0, we need to transcode
 We have an assets library URI, we need to transcode (video might be slow-mo).
 This is an Aux video.
 This is an HEVC video with alpha, and we want to remove alpha
 This is an HDR video, and we don't want to preserve HDR
That wasn't enough, let's look at filesize too:
SendableUTIs: %@
Is the original sendable without transcode? %@
Found size %llu of file %@ with error %@
   Carrier supports H264, selecting: %@
   Carrier does not support H264, selecting: %@
No audio/video tracks, failing transcode.
Actually, using the audio preset
Using preset %@ for audio/video transcoding (preserveHEVC %@ isHEVCWithAlpha %@ removeAlpha %@)
Using a standard AVAssetExportSession.
Supported file types: %@

     Setting time range
     Ignoring time range, transcoding full

NeedsTranscode? %@ isHEVC %@ isHDR %@
Transfer %@ doesn't need any processing

Using a dispatch group when generating multiple video transcodings
Asset to use for bigSize: %@
Just because we have to transcode to get the small rep, we might be able to use the original for the big rep
Do we need to transcode to get the big representation? %@ (removeAlphaFromAnimojiV2 %@ isHDR %@ preserveHEVC %@)
Transcoding bigSize finished with size %llu removeAlpha %@ path %@ and error %@

Adding bigURL %@ to outputPaths with context: %@
actualBigSize: %llu   smallSize %zu
Only using the big representation because the big output (%llu) fits in the small requirements (%zu)
bigURL was too big for smallSize or there was a FS error
Generating the big representation was not successful. Let's potentially try for small.
We didn't have to transcode to get the big representation so we know we have to for the small one.
There were two sizes requested && big doesn't satisfy the requirements for both, generating small. removeAlphaForAnimojiV2 %@ isHDR %@

 We have an assets library URI, we need to transcode (video might be slow-mo).
 This is an Aux video.
 This is an HEVC video with alpha, and we want to remove alpha
 This is an HDR video, and we don't want to preserve HDR
That wasn't enough, let's look at filesize too:
