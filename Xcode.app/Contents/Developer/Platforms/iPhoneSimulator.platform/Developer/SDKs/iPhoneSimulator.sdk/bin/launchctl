LAUNCHCTL_ENV_REEXEC
This subcommand requires root privileges: %s
Could not find domain for %s
Could not find service "%s" in domain for %s
Could not find service.
Command is not yet implemented.
Unrecognized subcommand: %s
Usage: %s <subcommand> ... | help [subcommand]
Many subcommands take a target specifier that refers to a domain or service within that domain. The available specifier forms are:
system/[service-name]
Targets the system-wide domain or service within. Root privileges are required to make modifications.
user/<uid>/[service-name]
Targets the user domain or service within. A process running as the target user may make modifications. Root may modify any user's domain. User domains do not exist on iOS.
gui/<uid>/[service-name]
Targets the GUI domain or service within. Each GUI domain is associated with a user domain, and a process running as the owner of that user domain may make modifications. Root may modify any GUI domain. GUI domains do not exist on iOS.
session/<asid>/[service-name]
Targets a session domain or service within. A process running within the target security audit session may make modifications. Root may modify any session domain.
pid/<pid>/[service-name]
Targets a process domain or service within. Only the process which owns the domain may modify it. Even root may not do so.
When using a legacy subcommand which manipulates a domain, the target domain is assumed to be the system domain. Only the user which owns the target instance of the launchd simulating the desired iOS environment may modify it.
Subcommands:
%-16s%s
%s%s
Bootstraps a domain or a service into a domain.
<domain-target> [service-path, service-path2, ...]
bootout
Tears down a domain or removes a service from a domain.
<domain-target> [service-path1, service-path2, ...] | <service-target>
enable
Enables an existing service.
<service-target>
disable
Disables an existing service.
uncache
Removes the specified service name from the service cache.
<service-name>
kickstart
Forces an existing service to start.
[-k] [-p] <service-target>
Terminates the service if it is already running.
Prints the PID of the service that was started.
Starts the service suspended so that a debugger may attach.
attach
Attach the system's debugger to a service.
[-k] [-s] [-x] <service-target>
Forces the service to start if it isn't already running.
Attaches to execution trampoline for the service (implies -k).
debug
Configures the next invocation of a service for debugging.
<service-target> [--program <program-path>] [--start-suspended] [--guard-malloc] [--malloc-stack-logging] [--malloc-nano-allocator] [--debug-libraries] [--NSZombie] [--32] [--stdin [path]] [--stdout [path]] [--stderr [path]] [--environment VARIABLE0=value0 VARIABLE1=value1 ...] -- [argv0 argv1 ...]
--program
Use a different binary for the service's executable.
--start-suspended
Start the process suspended.
--guard-malloc
Enable libgmalloc(3) for the service.
--malloc-stack-logging
Enable malloc(3) stack logging.
--malloc-nano-allocator
Enables the malloc(3) nano allocator.
--debug-libraries
Sets DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX to "_debug".
--NSZombie
Enables NSZombie
--32
Runs the service in 32-bit mode (only available on 64-bit platforms).
--stdin
When an argument is given, the file at that path is used as the service's stdin. With no argument, the current terminal is used as the service's stdin.
--stdout
When an argument is given, the file at that path is used as the service's stdout. With no argument, the current terminal is used as the service's stdout.
--stderr
When an argument is given, the file at that path is used as the service's stderr. With no argument, the current terminal is used as the service's stderr.
--environment
Set environment variables on the service.
kill
Sends a signal to the service instance.
<signal-number|signal-name> <service-target>
blame
Prints the reason a service is running.
print
Prints a description of a domain or service.
<target>
print-cache
Prints information about the service cache.
print-disabled
Prints which services are disabled.
plist
Prints a property list embedded in a binary (targets the Info.plist by default).
[segment,section] <path>
procinfo
Prints port information about a process.
<pid>
hostinfo
Prints port information about the host.
resolveport
Resolves a port name from a process to an endpoint in launchd.
<owner-pid> <port-name>
limit
Reads or modifies launchd's resource limits.
[<limit-name> [<both-limits> | <soft-limit> <hard-limit>]
runstats
Prints performance statistics for a service.
examine
Runs the specified analysis tool against launchd in a non-reentrant manner.
[<tool> [arg0, arg1, ... , @PID, ...]]
With no arguments, causes launchd to fork(2) itself for examination by subsequent analysis tools and prints the PID of this instance to stdout. You are responsible for killing this instance.
Alternatively, the arguments to this subcommand consist of an invocation of a tool with which to examine launchd, with the argument for the PID or process name replaced with the "@PID" argument. So to examine launchd for leaks, the invocation would be:
$ launchctl examine leaks @PID
config
Modifies persistent configuration parameters for launchd domains.
<system|user> <parameter> <value>
When given the "system" argument, modifies the configuration for the system domain. When given the "user" argument on supported platforms, modifies the configuration for all user domains. You must reboot for changes to take effect.
Note that if a service specifies a conflicting configuration, the service's parameter will be preferred.
Supported configuration parameters are:
umask <integer as octal>
Modifies the umask(2) applied to services launched in the domain.
path <string>
Modifies the PATH environment variable set on each service in the domain.
dumpstate
Dumps launchd state to stdout.
reboot
Initiates a system reboot of the specified type.
With no arguments or the "system" argument, causes launchd to begin a reboot of the system, equivalent to calling the reboot2() interface (not to be confused with the reboot(2) system call). When given the "userspace" argument, causes launchd to tear down userspace as it normally would, except that when userspace has quiesced, launchd will instead re-exec itself, providing for a faster reboot without re-initializing the hardware or kernel.
When rebooting the system, will bring the subsequent boot session up in single-user mode.
load
Bootstraps a service or directory of services.
<service-path, service-path2, ...>
If the service is disabled, it will be enabled. In previous versions of launchd, being disabled meant that a service was not loaded. Now, services are always loaded. If a service is disabled, launchd does not advertise its service endpoints (sockets, Mach ports, etc.).
Forcibly load the service. This flag will ignore the service's disabled state. In previous versions of launchd, this flag would also ignore the ownership and permissions of the specified launchd.plist. This is no longer the case. Note that, unlike the -w flag, this flag will not  modify the service's disabled state; it will instead only ignore it for the load operation.
-S <session>
This flag takes a single argument which is the name of a session and may only be used when loading agents. All daemons exist within the same session, which is the system session. Agents may designate which sessions they can be loaded in with the LimitLoadToSessionType key.
-D <domain>
Loads launchd.plist(5) files from the specified domain. Depending on the current execution context, launchctl will look in a LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents directory for launchd.plists. When running in the system's execution context (i.e. when run as root via a root shell or with sudo), the LaunchDaemons directory is searched. When running in a user's context (i.e. run normally from a shell), the LaunchAgents directory is searched. Valid domains are:
system
Searches /System/Library for either daemons or agents.
local
Searches /Library for either daemons or agents.
network
Searches /Network. This session type is no longer valid.
user
Searches the home directory of the calling user for agents only. Daemons may not be loaded from this domain.
unload
Unloads a service or directory of services.
Additionally disables the service such that future load operations will result in a service which launchd tracks but cannot be launched or discovered in any way.
Only unloads the services associated with the specified session.
Unloads launchd.plist(5) files from the specified domain. See the discussion regarding this same flag when given to the load subcommand for further details.
remove
Unloads the specified service name.
list
Lists information about services.
[service-name]
start
Starts the specified service.
stop
Stops the specified service if it is running.
setenv
Sets the specified environment variables for all services within the domain.
<<key> <value>, ...>
unsetenv
Unsets the specified environment variables for all services within the domain.
<key, ...>
getenv
Gets the value of an environment variable from within launchd.
<key>
bsexec
Execute a program in another process' bootstrap context.
<pid> <program> [...]
submit
Submit a basic job from the command line.
-l <label> [-p <program>] [-o <stdout-path>] [-e <stderr-path] -- <command> [arg0, arg1, ...]
managerpid
Prints the PID of the launchd controlling the session.
manageruid
Prints the UID of the current launchd session.
managername
Prints the name of the current launchd session.
error
Prints a description of an error.
[posix|mach|bootstrap] <code>
