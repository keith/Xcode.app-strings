Getting %lu accessibility elements, with options %{public}@.
The original elementOrOrderedChildrenContainer was actually a sibling since self was one of its supplementary views.  Correcting for this yields %{public}@.
Self is %{public}@.  Ordered children container is %{public}@.
We got to the top without finding a UIAccessibilityContainer node.  Our parent is the root node, the application.
We were able to find the child %{public}@ at index %ld.
The node was not a direct child of the ancestor UIAccessibilityContainer (container elements %{public}@).  Time to go up the chain and find that child...
Could not find %{public}@ in a list of sorted view [parent: %{public}@] siblings %{public}@.  If this happened right around a screen change, it might be okay, but otherwise this is probably a bug.

The remote element was the root node, so there should have been no parent.

Tried to get elements in the previous direction for scanner groups.  This is currently an unexpected scenario.
Scanner should not be stopping at remote elements.  We pretty much only want to short-circuit at that point when fetching next/previous elements.

Went all the way up the container chain from %@, but could not find any container that was one of the ordered children of %@.  This may be acceptable if it happened right around a layout change, but it would be best to double check by swiping left/right to see if you can get to all elements.
