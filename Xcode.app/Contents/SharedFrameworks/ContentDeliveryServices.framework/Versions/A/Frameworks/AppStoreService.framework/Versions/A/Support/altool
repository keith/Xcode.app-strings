Exit codes: 0 success, 1 failure (Upon failure, an error code and message are generally also displayed.)
Authentication: Most commands require authorization.
                There are two methods available: user name with password, and apiKey with apiIssuer.
                -u, --username <username> Username. Required to connect for validation, upload, and notarization.
                -p, --password <password> Password. Required if username specified. If this argument is not supplied on the command line,
                                          it will be read from stdin.
                                          Alternatively to entering <password> in plaintext, it may also be specified using a '@keychain:'
                                          or '@env:' prefix followed by a keychain password item name or environment variable name.
                                          Example: '-p @keychain:<name>' uses the password stored in the keychain password item named <name>.
                                                                         You can create and update keychain items with the
                                                                         --store-password-in-keychain-item command. Note also that the
                                                                         --username can be inferred from the keychain item so --username
                                                                         can be omitted when using a '-p @keychain:' option.
                                          Example: '-p @env:<variable>'  uses the value in the environment variable named <variable>
                --apiKey <api_key>        apiKey. Required for JWT authentication (in lieu of username/password).
                                          This option will search the following directories in sequence for a private key file
                                          with the name of 'AuthKey_<api_key>.p8': './private_keys', '~/private_keys', '~/.private_keys',
                                          and '~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys'. Additionally, you can set environment variable $API_PRIVATE_KEYS_DIR
                                          or a user default API_PRIVATE_KEYS_DIR to specify the directory where your AuthKey file is located.
                --apiIssuer <issuer_id>   Issuer ID. Required if --apiKey is specified.
 -f, --file <file>                        <file> specifies the path to the file to process.
 -t, --type {macos | ios | appletvos}     Specify the platform of the file, or of the host app when using --upload-hosted-content.
     --primary-bundle-id <bundle_id>      Used with --notarize-app to uniquely identify a package.
     --apple-id <id>                      Specifies the AppleID of the app package.
     --bundle-version <str>               Specifies the bundle version of the app package.
     --bundle-short-version-string <str>  Specifies the bundle short version string of the app package.
     --asc-provider <provider_shortname>  Required with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple
                                          providers and using username/password authentication. You can use the --list-providers command to retrieve
                                          the providers associated with your account. You may instead use --team-id or --asc-public-id.
     --asc-public-id <public_id>          Required with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple
                                          the providers associated with your account. You may instead use --asc-provider or --team-id.
     --team-id <wwdr_team_id>             Required with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple
                                          the providers associated with your account. You may instead use --asc-provider or --asc-public-id.
 -v, --validate-app                       Validates an app archive for the App Store. Authentication and -f are required.
     --upload-app                         Uploads the given app archive to the App Store. Authentication and -f are required. (DEPRECATED)
     --upload-hosted-content <file>       Uploads the specified hosted content in-app purchase archive to the App Store. Authentication is required.
     --bundle-id <id>                     Used with --upload-package to specify the app's bundle ID.
     --product-id <id>                    Used with --upload-hosted-content to specify the package's product ID.
     --sku <sku>                          Used with --upload-hosted-content to specify the hosting app's SKU.
     --upload-package <file>              Uploads the specified app archive to the App Store. Authentication is required.
     --list-apps                          Display all apps associated with your account(s).
     --list-providers                     Displays a list of the providers associated with your account along with short name, team id, and public id.
                                          This command is useful to determine what to use with the --asc-provider, --asc-public-id, and --team-id options.
                                          Authentication is required.
     --notarize-app                       Uploads the given app package, dmg or zip file for notarization. Authentication, -f,
                                          and --primary-bundle-id are required. --asc-provider, --asc-public-id, or --team-id is required for an account
                                          associated with multiple providers. If successful, the UUID associated with the upload is returned.
     --notarization-info <uuid>           Returns the status and log file URL of a package previously uploaded for notarization with the specified <uuid>.
                                          Authentication is required. The log file can be retrieved with 'curl <log_file_url>'.
     --notarization-history <page>        Returns a list of all uploads submitted for notarization. <page> specifies a range of entries where 0
                                          returns the most recent number of entries. A new page value will be returned which can be used as the
                                          <page> value to the next use of --notarization-history and so forth until no more items are returned.
                                          Authentication is required. --asc-provider, --asc-public-id, or --team-id is required for an account
                                          associated with multiple providers.
     --store-password-in-keychain-item <name_for_keychain_item> -u <username> -p <password>
                                          Stores the password <password> in the keychain item named <name_for_keychain_item> associated with the account <username>.
                                          If an item with that name and account already exists in the keychain, its password will be updated. Otherwise a new item
                                          is created with that name. You can use this keychain item with the -p option to mask your password with other commands.
                                          Example: %@ --store-password-in-keychain-item MY_SECRET -u jappleseed@apple.com -p "MyP@ssw0rd!@78"
                                                   %@ --notarize-app -u jappleseed@apple.com -p @keychain:MY_SECRET [...]
     --keychain <filename>                Used with --store-password-in-keychain and the @keychain: option for -p lets you specify the path to a keychain
                                          file in which to store or from which to read the password. Cannot be used with the --sync option.
     --sync                               Used with --store-password-in-keychain to allow the keychain item to sync with your iCloud account and other devices
                                          associated with the account. Cannot by used with the --keychain option.
     --transport <transport(s)>           Allows you to specify the protocol used when using --upload-app or --notarize-app. You should only use this option when
                                          instructed by Apple. <transport(s)> can be one or more of the following separated by commas: Signiant, Aspera, DAV, HTTPS.
 -k, --throttle <Kbps>                    Allows you to limit the upload speed to <Kbps> kilobits per second. If not specified, then the default limit is used.
     --output-format {xml | json | normal} Specifies how the output is formatted. 'xml' and 'json' display the output in a structured format; 'normal' displays in
                                           an unstructured format (default).
     --show-progress                      Show progress during operation.
          -progress-width <n>             Show progress using <n> number of characters. Defaults to 20.
          -progress-bar-width <n>         Show the progress bar using <n> number of characters. Defaults to 100.
     --verbose                            Enable logging output.
 -h, --help                               Display this output.

Exit codes: 0 success, 1 failure (Upon failure, an error code and message are generally also displayed.)
Authentication: Most commands require authorization.
                There are two methods available: user name with password, and apiKey with apiIssuer.
                -u, --username <username> Username. Required to connect for validation, upload, and notarization.
                -p, --password <password> Password. Required if username specified. If this argument is not supplied on the command line,
                                          it will be read from stdin.
                                          Alternatively to entering <password> in plaintext, it may also be specified using a '@keychain:'
                                          or '@env:' prefix followed by a keychain password item name or environment variable name.
                                          Example: '-p @keychain:<name>' uses the password stored in the keychain password item named <name>.
                                                                         You can create and update keychain items with the
                                                                         --store-password-in-keychain-item command. Note also that the
                                                                         --username can be inferred from the keychain item so --username
                                                                         can be omitted when using a '-p @keychain:' option.
                                          Example: '-p @env:<variable>'  uses the value in the environment variable named <variable>
                --apiKey <api_key>        apiKey. Required for JWT authentication (in lieu of username/password).
                                          This option will search the following directories in sequence for a private key file
                                          with the name of 'AuthKey_<api_key>.p8': './private_keys', '~/private_keys', '~/.private_keys',
                                          and '~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys'. Additionally, you can set environment variable $API_PRIVATE_KEYS_DIR
                                          or a user default API_PRIVATE_KEYS_DIR to specify the directory where your AuthKey file is located.
                --apiIssuer <issuer_id>   Issuer ID. Required if --apiKey is specified.
 -f, --file <file>                        <file> specifies the path to the file to process.
 -t, --type {macos | ios | appletvos}     Specify the platform of the file, or of the host app when using --upload-hosted-content.
     --primary-bundle-id <bundle_id>      Used with --notarize-app to uniquely identify a package.
     --apple-id <id>                      Specifies the AppleID of the app package.
     --bundle-version <str>               Specifies the bundle version of the app package.
     --bundle-short-version-string <str>  Specifies the bundle short version string of the app package.
     --asc-provider <provider_shortname>  Required with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple
                                          providers and using username/password authentication. You can use the --list-providers command to retrieve
                                          the providers associated with your account. You may instead use --team-id or --asc-public-id.
     --asc-public-id <public_id>          Required with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple
                                          the providers associated with your account. You may instead use --asc-provider or --team-id.
     --team-id <wwdr_team_id>             Required with --notarize-app and --notarization-history when a user account is associated with multiple
                                          the providers associated with your account. You may instead use --asc-provider or --asc-public-id.
 -v, --validate-app                       Validates an app archive for the App Store. Authentication and -f are required.
     --upload-app                         Uploads the given app archive to the App Store. Authentication and -f are required. (DEPRECATED)
     --upload-hosted-content <file>       Uploads the specified hosted content in-app purchase archive to the App Store. Authentication is required.
     --bundle-id <id>                     Used with --upload-package to specify the app's bundle ID.
     --product-id <id>                    Used with --upload-hosted-content to specify the package's product ID.
     --sku <sku>                          Used with --upload-hosted-content to specify the hosting app's SKU.
     --upload-package <file>              Uploads the specified app archive to the App Store. Authentication is required.
     --list-apps                          Display all apps associated with your account(s).
     --list-providers                     Displays a list of the providers associated with your account along with short name, team id, and public id.
                                          This command is useful to determine what to use with the --asc-provider, --asc-public-id, and --team-id options.
                                          Authentication is required.
     --notarize-app                       Uploads the given app package, dmg or zip file for notarization. Authentication, -f,
                                          and --primary-bundle-id are required. --asc-provider, --asc-public-id, or --team-id is required for an account
                                          associated with multiple providers. If successful, the UUID associated with the upload is returned.
     --notarization-info <uuid>           Returns the status and log file URL of a package previously uploaded for notarization with the specified <uuid>.
                                          Authentication is required. The log file can be retrieved with 'curl <log_file_url>'.
     --notarization-history <page>        Returns a list of all uploads submitted for notarization. <page> specifies a range of entries where 0
                                          returns the most recent number of entries. A new page value will be returned which can be used as the
                                          <page> value to the next use of --notarization-history and so forth until no more items are returned.
                                          Authentication is required. --asc-provider, --asc-public-id, or --team-id is required for an account
                                          associated with multiple providers.
     --store-password-in-keychain-item <name_for_keychain_item> -u <username> -p <password>
                                          Stores the password <password> in the keychain item named <name_for_keychain_item> associated with the account <username>.
                                          If an item with that name and account already exists in the keychain, its password will be updated. Otherwise a new item
                                          is created with that name. You can use this keychain item with the -p option to mask your password with other commands.
                                          Example: %@ --store-password-in-keychain-item MY_SECRET -u jappleseed@apple.com -p "MyP@ssw0rd!@78"
                                                   %@ --notarize-app -u jappleseed@apple.com -p @keychain:MY_SECRET [...]
     --keychain <filename>                Used with --store-password-in-keychain and the @keychain: option for -p lets you specify the path to a keychain
                                          file in which to store or from which to read the password. Cannot be used with the --sync option.
     --sync                               Used with --store-password-in-keychain to allow the keychain item to sync with your iCloud account and other devices
                                          associated with the account. Cannot by used with the --keychain option.
     --transport <transport(s)>           Allows you to specify the protocol used when using --upload-app or --notarize-app. You should only use this option when
                                          instructed by Apple. <transport(s)> can be one or more of the following separated by commas: Signiant, Aspera, DAV, HTTPS.
 -k, --throttle <Kbps>                    Allows you to limit the upload speed to <Kbps> kilobits per second. If not specified, then the default limit is used.
     --output-format {xml | json | normal} Specifies how the output is formatted. 'xml' and 'json' display the output in a structured format; 'normal' displays in
                                           an unstructured format (default).
     --show-progress                      Show progress during operation.
          -progress-width <n>             Show progress using <n> number of characters. Defaults to 20.
          -progress-bar-width <n>         Show the progress bar using <n> number of characters. Defaults to 100.
     --verbose                            Enable logging output.
 -h, --help                               Display this output.
