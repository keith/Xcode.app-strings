The certificate used to sign "%@" has either expired or has been revoked. An updated certificate is required to sign and install the application.
"%@" cannot be installed on this device because of a policy prohibiting the installation of new applications. You may have parental controls and/or certain Screen Time features enabled on this device. They will need to be disabled before installation can continue.
Please see the Apple website for more information.
Please delete apps signed with your free account from this device to remain under the limit.
Devices running iOS versions 13.3.1 through 13.4.1, tvOS versions 13.3.1 through 13.4, and watchOS versions 6.1 through 6.2.1 are known to incorrectly count app extensions towards the limit of three apps permitted with free accounts. Please update the OS on your device to a more recent version.

The certificate used to sign "%@" has either expired or has been revoked. An updated certificate is required to sign and install the application.
"%@" cannot be installed on this device because of a policy prohibiting the installation of new applications. You may have parental controls and/or certain Screen Time features enabled on this device. They will need to be disabled before installation can continue.
Please see the Apple website for more information.
Please delete apps signed with your free account from this device to remain under the limit.
Devices running iOS versions 13.3.1 through 13.4.1, tvOS versions 13.3.1 through 13.4, and watchOS versions 6.1 through 6.2.1 are known to incorrectly count app extensions towards the limit of three apps permitted with free accounts. Please update the OS on your device to a more recent version.
